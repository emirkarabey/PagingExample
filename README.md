# Libraries Used

* [Architecture][10] - Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [lifecycle][22] - As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [livedata][52] - is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.


* [UI][30] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.

* Third party and miscellaneous libraries
  * [Retrofit][90] for turns your HTTP API into a Java interface
  * [Glide][94] for image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
  * [Paging][95] The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network.
